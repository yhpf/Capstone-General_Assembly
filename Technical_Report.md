## How you acquired your data? (including any sampling that you did)
I had different sources, here is a brief overview of how i acquired my data.<BR />

The 2 initial data sources were 2 data sets that I found on Kaggel:
- Spotify world wide daily song ranking:<BR /> 
https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking/<BR />
- Song lyrics:<BR /> 
https://www.kaggle.com/artimous/every-song-you-have-heard-almost/<BR />

I then had to add some more lyrics and more features.<BR />
- Additional song features from Spotify API (energy, mode, tempo, uri etc.)<BR />
https://developer.spotify.com/web-api
- Additional lyrics from Genius. Scraping through the API.<BR />
https://docs.genius.com/
- Last but not least I did add song lyrics by hand by googling the song to get the lyrics.
